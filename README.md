C code to control the altitude of a model helicopter fixed in a stand. Uses FreeRTOS.

This was written as part of developing a 'remote laboratory', my final year project at the University of Canterbury. For more details, see http://nickwareing.com/final-year-project-a-remote-laboratory/.

It is written for use on a Texas Instruments Stellaris LM3S1968 Cortex-M3 microcontroller (http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-lm3s1968).
